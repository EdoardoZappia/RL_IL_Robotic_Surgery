** WORK IN PROGRESS **

This project is divided into two parts:

Develop a reinforcement learning model capable of learning and reproducing the movement of an object based on images.

Develop an imitation learning model that learns from demonstrations (image-action pairs from point 1) to replicate the movement of an object.

The goal of the project is to create an imitation learning model to assist minimally invasive kidney surgeries performed using the Da Vinci system.

The problem is that such procedures require two surgeons: one actively performing the surgery and another manipulating the 3D kidney model to ensure that the digital model aligns with live images of the actual kidney. This project aims to develop a model that autonomously adjusts the 3D model, reducing the need for a second surgeon during the operation.
